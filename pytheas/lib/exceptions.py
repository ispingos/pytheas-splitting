================================================================================

Pytheas is a tool that aims to introduce a new mentality in shear-wave splitting analysis 
from local recordings, incorporating manual, semi- and fully- automatic methods under one 
Graphical User Interface. Integrating databases and offering compatibility with popular data 
and metadata file formats, Pytheas is designed with the simplification of analysis in mind, 
while, at the same time, enhanching the effectiveness of processing and quality control of results.

Pytheas is released under the GNU GPLv3 license.
